## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- npm publish: add registry authentication to release workflow

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Windows build: restrict `DiscoveredFile` size assertion to unix (different `PathBuf` layout on Windows MSVC)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- TypeScript project references: workspace discovery from `tsconfig.json` `references` field (additive with npm/pnpm workspaces, deduplicated by canonical path)
- Elementary cycle enumeration for circular dependencies (individual cycles within SCCs, max 20 per SCC, deterministic output)
- CSS Modules support (`.module.css`/`.module.scss`) with class name export tracking
- `fallow migrate` command to convert knip and jscpd configs
- CSS/SCSS file discovery with `@import`, `@use`, `@forward`, and `@apply` extraction
- Cross-workspace `exports` field subpath resolution with output→source fallback
- Pnpm content-addressable store detection for injected dependencies
- Cache-aware incremental parsing with `--performance` cache hit/miss stats
- Code Lens with export reference counts and click-to-navigate in LSP
- Duplication diagnostics and "Extract duplicate into function" code action in LSP
- VS Code extension CI, LSP binary builds, and marketplace publishing
- Nuxt `resolve_config()` for deep config parsing (modules, css, plugins, extends, postcss, path aliases)
- Circular dependency benchmarks vs madge and dpdm
- Inline suppression for circular dependencies (`fallow-ignore-file circular-dependency`)
- Backwards compatibility policy (`docs/backwards-compatibility.md`)
- JSON output schema documentation (`docs/output-schema.json`)

### Fixed
- UTF-8 boundary handling in duplication detection (multi-byte character safety)
- Exports map resolution robustness for cross-workspace imports
- Nested output subdirectory mapping (e.g., `dist/esm/utils.mjs` → `src/utils.ts`)
- Trace path matching for monorepo compatibility (canonicalized vs user-provided paths)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Production mode (`--production`) — excludes test/dev files, limits to production scripts, reports type-only imports
- Clone families with refactoring suggestions (extract function/module)
- Config schema generation (`fallow config-schema`) with `$schema` support for IDE autocomplete
- Duplication baselines (`--save-baseline` / `--baseline`) for incremental CI adoption
- Deep `resolve_config()` for all top 10 framework plugins (ESLint, Vite, Jest, Storybook, Tailwind, Webpack, TypeScript, Babel, Rollup, PostCSS)
- JSONC as default config format (with JSON and TOML still supported)
- Pre-commit hooks for fmt and clippy checks

### Changed
- Migrated repository to fallow-rs organization

### Fixed
- Detection accuracy: star re-export tracking, workspace plugins, JSX fallback
- GitHub Action YAML parse error and benchmark workflow

### Performance
- Optimized resolve, discovery, and duplication detection hotpaths

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Code duplication detection (`fallow dupes`) with suffix array + LCP algorithm
- 4 detection modes: strict, mild, weak, semantic
- Duplication benchmarks comparing fallow dupes vs jscpd (4-75x faster)
- Plugin system with 40 built-in framework plugins as single source of truth
- Dynamic import resolution (template literals, `import.meta.glob`, `require.context`)
- Vue/Svelte SFC parsing with `<script>` block extraction
- Dynamic member heuristics (Object.values/keys/entries, for..in, spread)
- GitHub Action with job summaries, PR comments, and `--sarif-file` flag
- LSP diagnostics for all 10 issue types

### Fixed
- CJS require analysis and namespace narrowing for detection accuracy

### Performance
- Clone detection pipeline optimized up to 177x faster vs initial implementation

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Roadmap and project documentation

### Changed
- Improved human report formatting

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Plugin system, baseline comparison, and `fallow fix` command
- Comprehensive test coverage for high-priority gaps
- CI regression tracking benchmarks

### Fixed
- Reduced false positives based on knip comparison across 31 projects
- Byte column counting, strip_prefix, and HashSet reuse
- Deduplicated imported_from paths in unlisted dependency reports

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-17
